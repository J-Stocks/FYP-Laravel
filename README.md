## Comparing the Database Schemas Generated by MVC Frameworks
This code provides a series of performance tests designed to facilitate comparisons between different database types that can be used by the Eloquent ORM.

## Set up
To set up and run these tests do as follows:
- Clone this repo using the following command: `git@github.com:J-Stocks/FYP-Laravel.git`. Or download the files from this repo as a .zip and extract them.
- Install the project dependencies using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/): `composer install`
- Create the .env file: `cp .env.example .env`
- Set up a database. Note the branch name that you have checked out, this indicates the database type that the project is currently configured for. Checkout another branch to test a different database type.
- Add the connection details for the database to the .env file, all the properties prefixed with "DB_" are required.
- Seed the database: `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`
- Generate an App Key: `php artisan key:generate`
- Run the tests using [PhpUnit](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/): `./vendor/bin/phpunit`.
- The test result will be logged in this location: `./storage/logs/dbtest.log`
